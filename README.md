# Getting Started with Nutri App - Development

To develop on this project, clone the repo using the command:

```bash
git@github.com:BenPughyy/nutriapp.git
```

When you have the project locally, run:

```bash
nvm use
```

This will install the correct version of node from the projects `.nvmrc` file, ensuring the same version of node across the development process.

After this has been done, run:

```bash
npm install
```

To install all required dependencies.

To start up the server on `localhost:3000`, run:

```bash
npm start
```
